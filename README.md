## What is the Markowitz portfolio solver:

The Markowitz portfolio solver is a mathematical tool used in finance to optimize investment portfolios by analyzing the risk and return of different assets. It helps investors create a diversified portfolio that minimizes risk while maximizing returns, by identifying the optimal mix of assets based on their individual risk and return profiles.

Three positives of the Markowitz portfolio solver are:

* Diversification: The solver encourages diversification, which can help reduce risk in a portfolio by spreading investments across different assets.
* Optimization: It uses a mathematical model to identify the optimal mix of assets that maximize expected returns for a given level of risk.
* Data-driven: It relies on historical data to estimate expected returns and risk, making it a useful tool for quantitative analysis.

Three negatives of the Markowitz portfolio solver are:

* Simplistic assumptions: The model makes some simplistic assumptions, such as assuming that asset returns follow a normal distribution, which may not always hold true in the real world.
* Historical data limitations: It relies on historical data to estimate future returns and risk, which may not accurately reflect current market conditions or future events.
* Black box: The model can be difficult to understand for non-experts, which may make it challenging for investors to interpret and apply its results.

The historical performance of the Markowitz portfolio solver has been generally positive, as it has been widely used in the finance industry for many years. However, there are limitations to relying solely on historical data, and investors should exercise caution when making investing decisions based solely on the results of the Markowitz portfolio solver. It is important to consider other factors such as market trends, economic conditions, and geopolitical risks that may impact future investment performance. Ultimately, the decision to use the Markowitz portfolio solver should be based on a thorough understanding of its assumptions and limitations, as well as an investor's individual risk tolerance and investment goals.

Thank you to all the creators of the dependencies for making the creation of the optimal portfolio solver possible. I am still a relative novice to programming and the groundwork being done by people vastly more intelligent and dedicated makes it possible for people like me to even attempt to make a difference through coding.
